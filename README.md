## Project Overview
This is a project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. The purpose of this project is to build a data science portfolio that effectively communicates the results of the analysis. It is a data-driven approach using Stack Overflow's developer survey data to determine the key factors contributing to job satisfaction of developers.

## Dataset Overview
The Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from career satisfaction and job search to education and opinions on open source software. [Data](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) of survey year 2019 and 2020 are used for this project.

## Code and Resources

**Medium Blog Post:** [What makes developers happy?](https://eden-ong.medium.com/are-programmers-happy-with-their-profession-163d69f9d937)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This project explores the following questions:
1. Are developers happy with their profession?
2. Which country has the happiest developers?
3. Can money buy happiness? Does organisation size matters?
4. In general, what drives developer to look for a new job?
5. Which languages are growing in popularity?

## Findings
- United States has the happiest developers while Netherlands ranked first in Europe. Tech employers in these countries are better at demonstrating how much they value their developers a bit better than others.
- rganization size does not play important role affecting the job satisfaction of developers. Instead, developers need more interesting code to work on and problems to solve in order to be fulfilled.
- Cash alone won't keep developers happy, and they constantly looking for opportunities. The need for professional development is something every developer has, regardless of their role, industry or location.
